[Verse 1]
Welcome to the city of lies where everything's got a price
Gonna be in your new favorite place
You can be a movie star and get everything you want
Just put some plastic on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
This place is a circus, you just see the surface
They cover shit under the rug
You can't see they're fakin', they'll never be naked
Just fill your drink with tonic gin, this is the American dream, so

[Chorus]
Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, so
Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Keep drinkin' and acting cool, don't care if your day is blue
Nobody loves a gloomy face, just
Take your pills and dance all night, don't think at all, that's the advice
So c'mon, let's try, it's just a taste
See upcoming rock shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists
